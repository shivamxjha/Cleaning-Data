# Source Data
Data is downloaded from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip The dataset includes the following files:

'README.txt'

'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

'features.txt': List of all features.

'activity_labels.txt': Links the data their activity name.

'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.

# R script
R code "run_analysis.R" performs the following steps

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

Read Training data set
Read Testing data set
Read Features
Read Activity labels
Merge traing and test data

2. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

3. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement

4. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

# Variables
x_train, y_train, x_test, y_test, subject_train and subject_test contain the data from the downloaded files. 
x_data, y_data and subject_data merge the previous datasets to further analysis.
